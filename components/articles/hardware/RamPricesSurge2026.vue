    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white">Why RAM Prices Are Surging in 2026</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300 text-base leading-relaxed">
      Memory prices have risen sharply, surprising PC builders, laptop shoppers, and companies that depend on predictable hardware costs.
      DDR4 and DDR5 modules now cost far more than they did just a year ago, and the increases show no sign of slowing.
      What looks like a simple shortage is actually the result of deeper structural changes across the semiconductor industry.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-gray-900 border border-gray-700 rounded-lg p-4">
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 mb-2">Current Market Situation:</p>
      <ul class="text-sm font-mono text-red-400 space-y-1">
        <li>DDR5 modules increased by 120% to 200% compared to early 2025</li>
        <li>Broader DRAM pricing indexes climbed nearly 50% year to date</li>
        <li>Contract prices for memory chips rose 30% to 60% in just a few months</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">What Is Happening to RAM Prices</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-300 text-base leading-relaxed">
      RAM prices have climbed across every major category: DDR4, DDR5, LPDDR5 for mobile devices, and server-class memory.
      In many regions, consumer-grade memory kits now cost two or even three times more than they did in 2023 or early 2024.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-300 text-base leading-relaxed mt-2">
      At the same time, memory availability is inconsistent. Retailers report that high-speed kits sell out faster.
      Laptop manufacturers face higher bill-of-materials costs. Even large enterprise buyers have reported partial fulfillment of bulk orders.
      In short: demand remains high, supply remains tight, and the market has shifted in favor of suppliers.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">Six Reasons Behind the Price Surge</h2>

    <ul class="space-y-4">
      <li class="bg-gray-700 p-4 rounded shadow">
        <p class="font-semibold text-white">1. AI Demand Is Consuming Memory Supply</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 mt-1">
          Modern AI data centers rely heavily on High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), an ultra-fast stacked memory essential for training large models.
          Since HBM uses the same foundational materials as DDR4 and DDR5, manufacturers are shifting capacity toward HBM because it offers
          higher revenue and long-term demand certainty. Fewer wafers and fabrication lines are left for standard DRAM.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="bg-gray-700 p-4 rounded shadow">
        <p class="font-semibold text-white">2. Wafers Are Limited and Expensive</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 mt-1">
          All DRAM begins with 300mm semiconductor wafers. These wafers are expensive, difficult to produce, and available only from
          a few global suppliers. As AI companies place massive long-term orders, wafer supply becomes stretched.
          Even if consumer demand stayed the same, wafer scarcity alone would push prices upward.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="bg-gray-700 p-4 rounded shadow">
        <p class="font-semibold text-white">3. Manufacturers Are Managing Supply to Protect Pricing</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 mt-1">
          For years, the memory market suffered from oversupply, which caused prices to crash. In response, manufacturers adopted
          a more controlled approach, scaling production carefully to avoid large inventory buildups. This helps stabilize profits
          but keeps prices high.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="bg-gray-700 p-4 rounded shadow">
        <p class="font-semibold text-white">4. DDR4 Is Being Phased Out</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 mt-1">
          DDR4 production was already declining as the industry transitioned toward DDR5. With wafer supply under pressure and HBM
          taking priority, manufacturers have accelerated the phase-out. Fewer DDR4 production lines means lower availability
          and higher prices, even for older systems.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="bg-gray-700 p-4 rounded shadow">
        <p class="font-semibold text-white">5. Devices Require More Memory Than Before</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 mt-1">
          The rise of AI in consumer devices, growth of handheld gaming PCs, and new Windows 11 requirements have all increased
          memory consumption. Many modern laptops ship with 16GB or 32GB. Phones increasingly use more RAM to support on-device AI features.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="bg-gray-700 p-4 rounded shadow">
        <p class="font-semibold text-white">6. HBM Packaging Is Slow and Difficult</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 mt-1">
          Even if manufacturers wanted to expand HBM production, packaging remains a bottleneck. HBM uses advanced through-silicon vias
          and stacked layers that require specialized facilities. Only a handful of plants worldwide can perform this work at scale.
        </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">How Long Will High Prices Last?</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-300 text-base leading-relaxed">
      Based on current industry conditions, elevated memory prices are likely to persist through all of 2026 and at least into early or mid-2027.

      <ul class="text-sm text-gray-300 space-y-1">
        <li>Large AI companies have placed long-term HBM orders lasting several years</li>
        <li>Wafer production capacity cannot scale quickly (requires new fabs and suppliers)</li>
        <li>HBM packaging remains the slowest part of the supply chain</li>
        <li>DDR4 phase-out is accelerating, not slowing</li>

    <p class="text-gray-300 text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
      New fabrication facilities in Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and the United States may help,
      but most will not reach high-volume output until late 2027 or 2028.
      Short-term discounts may appear during sales events, but a major price correction is unlikely in the near future.

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-300 text-base leading-relaxed">
      The 2026 memory market reflects a major industry shift driven by AI demand, wafer constraints, controlled production strategies,
      and rising memory requirements across modern devices. Together, these forces have pushed RAM prices to some of the highest levels seen in recent years.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-300 text-base leading-relaxed mt-2">
      While supply conditions are expected to improve over time, higher memory pricing is likely to persist throughout the year.
      For consumers and businesses planning hardware upgrades, delaying a purchase may result in paying more for comparable performance
      as component costs continue to climb.
