    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white">AI and the Future of Work: What Young People Must Understand Now</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300 text-base leading-relaxed">
      At the World Economic Forum in Davos, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva delivered a stark warning: artificial intelligence will hit the labor market like a "tsunami," with young people bearing the brunt of the impact.
      The numbers are sobering: 60% of jobs in advanced economies will be affected by AI, either enhanced, transformed or eliminated entirely.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-gray-900 border border-gray-700 rounded-lg p-4">
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 mb-2">IMF Projections:</p>
      <ul class="text-sm font-mono text-yellow-400 space-y-1">
        <li>60% of jobs in advanced economies affected by AI</li>
        <li>40% of jobs globally will see AI impact</li>
        <li>1 in 10 jobs already "enhanced" by AI (with pay increases)</li>
        <li>Entry-level positions face highest elimination risk</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">The Entry-Level Problem</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-300 text-base leading-relaxed">
      Georgieva pointed to a troubling pattern: the tasks being eliminated are precisely those that entry-level jobs typically involve.
      Young people searching for their first positions find fewer opportunities, while workers in the middle face wage stagnation without the productivity boost that AI provides to enhanced roles.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 text-base leading-relaxed mt-2">
      The traditional career ladder, where graduates start with routine tasks and gradually take on more responsibility, is being dismantled.
      AI excels at exactly the kind of structured, repetitive work that junior employees once used as a stepping stone.
      Data entry, basic analysis, scheduling, preliminary research: these are no longer guaranteed pathways into an industry.
    </p>

      <p class="text-sm text-red-300 mb-2"><strong class="text-white">The Warning:</strong></p>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-300">
        "This is moving so fast, and yet we don't know how to make it safe. We don't know how to make it inclusive. Wake up, AI is for real, and it is transforming our world faster than we are getting ahead of it."

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">What AI Cannot Take</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-300 text-base leading-relaxed">
      Here is the uncomfortable truth that gets lost in the doom headlines: AI is exceptionally good at pattern recognition, optimization and executing defined tasks at scale.
      It is remarkably poor at genuine creativity, original thinking and navigating truly novel situations.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 text-base leading-relaxed mt-2">
      Large language models do not invent. They recombine. They generate plausible outputs based on statistical patterns in training data.
      When you ask an AI to write a story, it produces something that resembles millions of stories it has seen. It cannot imagine what has never existed.
    </p>

    <ul class="space-y-4 mt-4">
      <li class="bg-gray-700 p-4 rounded shadow">
        <p class="font-semibold text-white">Imagination</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 mt-1">
          The ability to conceive of things that do not yet exist. To ask "what if" in ways that have never been asked before.
          Every breakthrough technology, every paradigm shift, every work of art that moved humanity forward came from human imagination.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="bg-gray-700 p-4 rounded shadow">
        <p class="font-semibold text-white">Inventiveness</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 mt-1">
          The capacity to solve problems in unexpected ways. To connect domains that seem unrelated.
          AI can optimize within constraints; humans can question whether the constraints themselves make sense.

      </li>
      <li class="bg-gray-700 p-4 rounded shadow">
        <p class="font-semibold text-white">Judgment Under Uncertainty</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 mt-1">
          Real decisions involve incomplete information, competing values and stakes that cannot be quantified.
          Humans navigate ambiguity. AI requires clearly defined objectives and measurable outcomes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="bg-gray-700 p-4 rounded shadow">
        <p class="font-semibold text-white">Meaning and Purpose</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 mt-1">
          AI does not care why it does what it does. It has no sense of purpose, no drive to create something that matters.
          The question "why should this exist?" is fundamentally human.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">Education Must Change First</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300 text-base leading-relaxed">
      If the labor market is being reshaped at unprecedented speed, then the institutions preparing young people for that market need to transform just as quickly.
      This is where schools, universities and training programs face their most urgent challenge.
    </p>

      <p class="text-sm text-blue-300 mb-2"><strong class="text-white">The New Educational Imperative:</strong></p>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-300">
        Schools should not be teaching students to compete with AI at tasks AI will always do better.
        They should be teaching students to use AI as a tool that amplifies uniquely human capabilities.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
      Consider what this means in practice:

        <p class="font-semibold text-white">AI as a Learning Accelerator</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 mt-1">
          Students can use AI to explore complex topics, generate explanations at their level of understanding, and test their knowledge through interactive dialogue.
          A student struggling with calculus can have a personalized tutor available at any hour.
          The teacher's role shifts from information delivery to mentorship and critical thinking development.

      </li>
      <li class="bg-gray-700 p-4 rounded shadow">
        <p class="font-semibold text-white">AI as a Creative Partner</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 mt-1">
          Writers can use AI to brainstorm, to explore variations on ideas, to handle the mechanical aspects of drafting while focusing on the vision and voice that make work meaningful.
          Designers can generate dozens of starting points and then apply human judgment to refine and direct.
          Musicians can experiment with arrangements and then bring the emotional intention that transforms notes into art.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="bg-gray-700 p-4 rounded shadow">
        <p class="font-semibold text-white">AI as an Innovation Tool</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 mt-1">
          Students should learn to prompt effectively, to evaluate AI outputs critically, to recognize when AI is hallucinating or missing the point.
          These are new literacies as fundamental as reading and writing.
          The goal is not to depend on AI but to direct it.

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">The Industrial Revolution Parallel</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300 text-base leading-relaxed">
      We have been here before, in a sense. The Industrial Revolution displaced millions of agricultural workers, destroyed entire categories of skilled craft labor, and created social upheaval that took generations to resolve.
      It also built the foundation for unprecedented prosperity, longer lives and opportunities that would have been unimaginable to previous generations.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 text-base leading-relaxed mt-2">
      The difference now is speed. The transition from agricultural to industrial society played out over a century.
      The AI transformation is happening in years, not decades. Workers who trained for careers that existed when they entered school may find those careers obsolete before they graduate.

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">Human Adaptability: Our Greatest Asset</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300 text-base leading-relaxed">
      If there is reason for optimism, it lies in the one trait that has carried our species through every existential challenge: adaptability.
      Humans survived ice ages, plagues, world wars and technological revolutions that would have seemed impossible to navigate.
      We are not defined by the tools we use but by our capacity to learn new tools, to reimagine our relationship with work, to find meaning in changing circumstances.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 text-base leading-relaxed mt-2">
      The generation entering the workforce now will need to reinvent themselves multiple times throughout their careers.
      This is not a failure of planning; it is the new reality.
      The students who will thrive are those who learn to see AI not as a threat to their livelihood but as an extension of their capabilities.

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">A Call to Action for Young People</h2>

    <div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-indigo-900/40 to-purple-900/40 border border-indigo-600/50 rounded-lg p-6">
      <ul class="text-gray-300 space-y-2">
        <li><strong class="text-white">Learn AI tools now.</strong> Do not wait for schools to teach them. Experiment. Break things. Understand what AI can and cannot do through direct experience.</li>
        <li><strong class="text-white">Cultivate irreplaceable skills.</strong> Creativity, leadership, ethical judgment, emotional intelligence, the ability to ask questions no one has thought to ask.</li>
        <li><strong class="text-white">Think like a collaborator, not a competitor.</strong> The question is not "will AI take my job?" but "how can I do work that AI makes more valuable?"</li>
        <li><strong class="text-white">Stay flexible.</strong> Your first career may not be your last. Build skills that transfer across domains.</li>
        <li><strong class="text-white">Demand better education.</strong> Push for curricula that prepare you for the world as it will be, not the world as it was.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-300 text-base leading-relaxed">
      The IMF's warning is serious and should not be dismissed. The disruption is real, the timeline is compressed, and the stakes are high.
      But fatalism is not the answer. Every technological revolution has created new categories of work that were previously unimaginable.
      The jobs that will matter in 2035 may not have names yet.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-300 text-base leading-relaxed mt-2">
      What separates those who struggle from those who thrive will not be technical skill alone.
      It will be the capacity to imagine, to invent, to adapt, and to bring human judgment to problems that machines cannot fully understand.
      These are the capabilities that no algorithm can replicate. They are what make us human.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-300 text-base leading-relaxed mt-2">
      The future is not written. It will be built by those who refuse to be passive observers of their own displacement.
      This generation has the opportunity to redefine what work means, what education prepares us for, and how humans and machines can create value together.
      That is not a burden. It is a challenge worthy of a species that has survived every challenge before it.
